Description: '`assortr` provides functions to simulate group switching behavior and create weighted, undirected social networks based on the proportion of time dyads spend together -- the simple ratio index. `assortr` borrows the simulated annealing algorithm of `rnetcarto` to identify modules within the network which it uses as the basis for calculating the assortativity coefficient of the graph. Additional functions help assess the robustness of user-defined sampling schemes'.
